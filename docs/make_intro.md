# Create an introductory HTML page for TogoMCP
TogoMCP is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides LLM agents with access to a vast ecosystem of life sciences databases through SPARQL queries, RDF data exploration, and ID conversion services. It integrates over 20 major biological and biomedical databases, offering researchers a powerful toolkit for cross-database queries, data integration, and knowledge discovery.

The TogoMCP endpoint is available at https://togomcp.rdfportal.org/mcp.
It is developed by DBCLS.

## Goal

- Summary of TogoMCP
- Usage examples
- Setup guide
- List of available databases
- List of available tools


## Study TogoMCP
